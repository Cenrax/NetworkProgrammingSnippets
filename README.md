# NetworkProgrammingSnippets
These are the basic code snippets which I am learning to enhance my knowledge in network programming using python. Network programming is very important in respect of today's world.

## Network Programming
Computer network programming involves writing computer programs that enable processes to communicate with each other across a computer network.

For connection-oriented communications, communication parties usually have different roles. One party is usually waiting for incoming connections; this party is usually referred to as "server". Another party is the one which initiates connection; this party is usually referred to as "client".

For connectionless communications, one party ("server") is usually waiting for an incoming packet, and another party ("client") is usually understood as the one which sends an unsolicited packet to "server".
